# LOCALIZATION NOTE(looking_up_settings_guess): We are checking common server names like pop., pop3., smtp., mail., without knowing whether they exist or really serve this email account. If a server responds, we try to talk to it via POP/IMAP/SMTP protocols and query its capabilities. If that succeeds, we assume we found a configuration. Of course, it may still be wrong, but it often works.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE(found_settings_guess): We tried common mail server names and we found a mail server and talked to it and it responded properly, so we think we found a suitable configuration, but we are only about 80% certain that it is the correct setting for this email address. There's a chance that email address may not actually be served by this server and it won't work, or that there is a better server.
