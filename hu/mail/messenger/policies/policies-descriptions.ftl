## The Enterprise Policies feature is aimed at system administrators
## who want to deploy these settings across several Thunderbird installations
## all at once. This is traditionally done through the Windows Group Policy
## feature, but the system also supports other forms of deployment.
## These are short descriptions for individual policies, to be displayed
## in the documentation section in about:policies.

policy-DisableTelemetry = Telemetria kikapcsolása.
policy-DNSOverHTTPS = HTTPS feletti DNS beállítása.
# For more information, see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/PKCS11/Module_Installation
