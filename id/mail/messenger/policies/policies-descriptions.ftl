## The Enterprise Policies feature is aimed at system administrators
## who want to deploy these settings across several Thunderbird installations
## all at once. This is traditionally done through the Windows Group Policy
## feature, but the system also supports other forms of deployment.
## These are short descriptions for individual policies, to be displayed
## in the documentation section in about:policies.

policy-3rdparty = Tetapkan kebijakan yang dapat diakses WebExtensions melalui chrome.storage.managed.
policy-AppAutoUpdate = Mengaktifkan atau menonaktifkan pembaruan aplikasi otomatis.
policy-DisabledCiphers = Nonaktifkan ciphers.
policy-DefaultDownloadDirectory = Tetapkan direktori unduhan asal.
policy-DisableAppUpdate = Cegah { -brand-short-name } dari pembaruan.
policy-DisableTelemetry = Nonaktifkan Telemetry.
