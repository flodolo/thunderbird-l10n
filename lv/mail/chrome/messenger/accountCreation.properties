# LOCALIZATION NOTE(looking_up_settings_disk): Referring to Thunderbird installation folder on user's harddisk. %1$S will be the brandShortName.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE(looking_up_settings_db): Do not translate or replace Mozilla. It stands for the public project mozilla.org, not Mozilla Corporation. The database is a generic, public domain facility usable by any client.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE(looking_up_settings_exchange): Exchange is a product name
# LOCALIZATION NOTE(looking_up_settings_guess): We are checking common server names like pop., pop3., smtp., mail., without knowing whether they exist or really serve this email account. If a server responds, we try to talk to it via POP/IMAP/SMTP protocols and query its capabilities. If that succeeds, we assume we found a configuration. Of course, it may still be wrong, but it often works.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE(found_settings_disk): Referring to Thunderbird installation folder on user's harddisk. %1$S will be the brandShortName.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE(found_settings_db): Do not translate or replace Mozilla. It stands for the public project mozilla.org, not Mozilla Corporation. The database is a generic, public domain facility usable by any client.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE(found_settings_exchange): Microsoft Exchange is a product name.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE(found_settings_guess): We tried common mail server names and we found a mail server and talked to it and it responded properly, so we think we found a suitable configuration, but we are only about 80% certain that it is the correct setting for this email address. There's a chance that email address may not actually be served by this server and it won't work, or that there is a better server.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE(failed_to_find_settings): %1$S will be the brandShortName.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE(guessed_settings_offline) User is offline, so we just took a wild guess and the user will have to enter the right settings.

# add-on install
# LOCALIZATION NOTE(addonInstallLabel): %1$S will be the add-on name

# LOCALIZATION NOTE(resultUnknown): Displayed instead of resultIncoming,
# resultOutgoing or resultUsername when we don't have a proper value.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE(resultNoEncryption): Neither SSL/TLS nor STARTTLS. Transmission of emails in cleartext over the Internet.
resultSSLCertOK=


# LOCALIZATION NOTE(credentials_incomplete): The reference to "janedoe" (Jane Doe) is the name of an example person. You will want to translate it to whatever example persons would be named in your language. In the example, AD is the name of the Windows domain, and this should usually not be translated.
# LOCALIZATION NOTE(otherDomain.label): %1$S will be the brandShortName. %2$S refers to the domain name, e.g. rackspace.com
