# Thunderbird Localizations

This repository contains the localized messages for all Thunderbird locales.

If you’d like to submit translations or suggest improvements to existing
strings please visit us on [Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird/).
Changes to translations will not be accepted by pull request.


## String updates

This repo contains only localized files;
source strings are located in the 
[thunderbird-l10n-source](https://github.com/thunderbird/thunderbird-l10n-source/)
repository.

Newly translated strings are committed to the `main` branch
via Pontoon’s [translation sync](https://github.com/mozilla/pontoon/blob/main/pontoon/sync/README.md).
